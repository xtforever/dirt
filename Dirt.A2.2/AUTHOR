The UKC Widget Set and the Dirt User Interface Builder / Editor
was designed and implemented by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) at the
University of Kent at Canterbury, United Kingdom.

The Widget Creation Library was produced by David E. Smyth
(david@devvax.jpl.nasa.gov) and has been included with his kind permission.

Some of the Widgets in the UKC Widget Set were derived from similar
widgets in the Athena Widget Set.  These have been clearly marked as such.

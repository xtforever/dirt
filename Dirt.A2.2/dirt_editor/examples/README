		Dirt UI builder example applications

Release: Alpha
Author: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk)

This directory contains example Dirt generated user interfaces and a single
minimal application driving program.

These examples are built during the toplevel "make World" and can be remade
using just "make" in this directory.  To run any of these examples you
should set on of the following environment variables to the absolute pathname
of this directory, e.g.:

	% setenv XAPPLRESDIR `pwd`
or
	% setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH `pwd`

then just type the example name.

The "templates" directory contains example templates for Dirt to use.
To use these templates you must use the "-templates" flag to dirt, e.g.:

	% dirt -templates examples/templates

To load in any of the example dirt specification files you can use:

	% dirt -specFile [ perly | resource | ... ]

Be careful about saving changes to these files, they are set to read-only
in the distribution.

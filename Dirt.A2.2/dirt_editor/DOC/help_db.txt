		Adding Entries to Dirt On-line Help Database

The Dirt help database is basically an X Resource Manager database that is
looked up whenever on-line help is required from within Dirt, see
./Dirt/dirt_editor/help.c for its use.  It contains three main areas of
entries; Resource Type Definitions, Widget Class Definitions and Resource
Definitions.

Resource Type Definitions:
	Are of the form "type`ResourceTypeName`" and give a brief description
	of this resource type and what values it can be set to, e.g.:
	  "typeBoolean:  A Boolean can only have two values, TRUE or FALSE."

Widget Class Definitions:
	Are a full description of the Widget Class itself.  This description
	is split into three parts: "fullName", "vendor" and "description".
	For example, the Athena AsciiSink Object Class has the following help
	entries:

	  asciiSinkObjectClass.fullName: Ascii Sink Object
	  asciiSinkObjectClass.vendor: Project Athena / MIT
	  asciiSinkObjectClass.description: The AsciiSink object is used by a
	  text widget to render the text.  It will display all Latin1 Characters
	  in an 8 bit font, Tab and Carriage Return.  The name may be a bit
	  misleading, but is left this way for compatibility.  This object
	  also reports the text window metrics to the text widgets.

	The prefix "asciiSinkObjectClass" *must* be the same as the
	"class_name" entry in the widget classes table in
	./Dirt/dirt_editor/widget_classes.c

	The description must be a single resource database entry therefore
	any newline characters that you wish to include in the description
	should be given as "\n\".

Resource Definitions:
	Are a full description of what an individual resource does in a
	particular widget/object class.  Due to the inheritance of superclass
	resources by subclasses only those resources defined in a particular
	class need to be entered in this database.  The entries are given as
	"widgetClassName"."resourceName", e.g.:

	  boxWidgetClass.hSpace: The amount of space, in pixels, to leave
	  between the children.  This resource specifies the amount of space
	  left between the outermost children and the edge of the box.

	The help system searches for resource description entries in a
	subclass to superclass order.  Therefore it is possible to override a
	superclasses definition of a resource using the subclass name
	as this will be searched for first, e.g.:

		"boxWidgetClass.background: a colour that represents ..."

	will override:

		"widgetClass.background: A pixel value which indexes ..."

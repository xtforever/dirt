# SCCSID: @(#)CHANGES	1.2 (UKC) 6/30/92

Alpha Release 2.2		June 1992

This patchlevel fixes numerous problems that come to light over the last
few months.

I big set of minor changes were contributed by Vincent Newsum to get Dirt
through lint.  Thanks Vincent!

Robert Withrow told me where to look for the core dumping problem many
people have been seeing associated with text widgets.  It was all my
fault!  I was using XawAsciiSourceFreeString() incorrectly, sorry about
that 8-(.

I have been cleaning up the Imakefiles and found better ways to build
things (including shared libraries on Suns -- Thanks to the person
whose name I forget who told me how to do it, let me know who you are
and I will put your name here 8-).

I've added a new function XukcAddToBitmapFilePath(), which adds a string
the currently defined "BitmapFilePath" resource which is used by
XmuLocateBitmap() which is inturn used by the StringTo{Pixmap/Bitmap}
converters. This should hopefully stop all the annoying "cannot convert
blah to bitmap" warnings which were holding people up.

Alpha Release 2.1		Jan 26 1992

This patchlevel fixes a serious bug in the code generation functions.
The WI_*_classes[] array in *_layout.h file can be incorrectly
generated [Timothy H Panton].

In widget_classes.c "List.h" was listed as "list.h" [Oliver Beran].

Imakefile.GNU does not clean up all the object files [Olaf Gerloff].

The -sortByName and -sortByType command line arguments have been added to
the manual.

Alpha Release 2.0

There has been some major internal changes between the first Alpha
release and this second Alpha release.  More internal support for
Motif has been added, although I cannot claim that Dirt really does
support Motif yet 8-(.

This release should build with either X11R4 (patchlevel 18) or X11R5 (I
tested it with no patches applied).

There are a couple of interface differences that people should be aware
of:

1)  "Locks" have been added to X, Y, Width and Height resources on all
    Widget instances.  This means that the size/positions of object
    instances can be explicitly set by "locking" them (using the little
    graphical lock next to the position/dimension).  In the previous
    release this was always done .. this meant that you could not create
    interfaces that were independent of font for example.  Now, by
    default, all sizes/positions are not output unless their associated
    lock has been set (or they are required to stop "zero width/height
    errors").  With no locks set Widgets like the Label widget will
    determine its own default size based on the text and font given to
    it.

    This has some impact on previous dirt_spec files.  In order to
    update existing dirt_spec files you should load them in and then
    *immediately* save them (keep a backup of course!).  Dirt will save
    them out using the new style.  Most of your existing objects in a
    dirt_spec file will have locked size/position resources.  You should
    edit each object interactively and toggle the resource locks to
    unlock the size/position.  Once you have changed all the required
    objects you can save the new dirt_spec file.

2)  Due to change (for the good!) in R5, I have had to change the
    programming interface to one routine that is output in the code
    created by Dirt.  The routine is: XukcDirtRegisterApplicationDefaults()
    Its new definition is:

	XukcDirtRegisterApplicationDefaults(screen, defs, n_defs)
	   Screen *screen;
	   String defs[];
	   Cardinal n_defs;

    Therefore the first argument is now a Screen pointer rather than a
    Display pointer.  If you use this routine you should adjust your code
    and regenerate your interface.

These two changes have been documented in the Dirt manual.  I have also
added a de-latexed version in plain ascii, its not pretty but its the
closest you'll get to troff 8-).

/* SCCSID: @(#)README	1.1 (UKC) 5/10/92 */

        The UKC Widget Set, utilities and Widget Creation Library

Release: Alpha.2
Patchlevel: 2

This directory contains the UKC widget set and associated utilities routines
that form the libXukc.a library.  It also contains a copy of the 1.06
distribution of the Widget Creation library, libWc.a written by
David Smyth and Martin Brunecky.

The only change to the Widget Creation library made here for its use with
Dirt is that of a new Imakefile.  To install a newer version of Wc copy over
all the files except for the Imakefile.  I have only included the Widget
Creation Library itself and not the example programs that come with the
full distribution.

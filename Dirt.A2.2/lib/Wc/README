Widget Creation Library is a simple package allowing to define the
X toolkit widget hierarchies and their binding to the application
using X resource files. Several convenience callbacks and action
procedures are provided to support the basic widget tree dynamics.

Widget Creation Library (Wcl) 1.06 is a re-packaged version of David
Smyth's Wcl 1.05. The major functionality change is the addition of
template instancing and support for OLIT and Cornell University
widget sets. Minor changes are due to several bug fixes.
For details, please refer to RELEASE.NOTES in the Doc/ subdirectory.
